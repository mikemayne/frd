It's not straightforward to share a visual studio project that uses the gtest plugin (PR most welcome if I'm wrong).
gtest is very simple to setup for Visual studio though, you can find instructions here:

You'll need to remove precompiled headers under Configuration Properties -> c/c++ -> Pre Compiled Headers -> Pre Compiled Header = Not Using Precompiled headers
You'll also need to set the current working directory to this directory, Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Working Directory (just browse, or enter ..\..)
You might need to remove the precompiled headers too. 

Alternatively you should be able to build the project with the makefile under Cygwin (Not tested).
